# nowness
A visual reproduction of nowness.com homepage demonstrating writing HTML & CSS, using flexbox. No JS.

Starting from scratch, I build a fully responsive homepage that matches the different breakpoint design images (screenshots) exactly. Links, horizontal scrolling divs and animation work as per original website.

To avoid CORS issues this page must be served and not opened from the file system.
